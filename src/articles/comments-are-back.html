<h1>The comments are back</h1>

<p>
    The comments were removed from this blog since I started to host it on GitHub pages. I just added a new one using Disqus.
</p>
<p>
    I can't say I'm really comfortable with the idea of adding a third party dependency to my blog, but it's a very convenient solution.
</p>
<p>
    I'm also aware of the privacy matter. That's why I made it so it's disabled by default, and clicking on the "Show comments" button is required to enable the Disquss plugin.
