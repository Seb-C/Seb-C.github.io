<h1>Blogging in English</h1>

<p>
    Since the beginning, this blog was written in French, because it's my native language. At this time, I also wasn't very confident with my English level.

<p>
    I have decided that I will now write new articles in English instead of French. I translated the main parts of the page (like menus, title... yeah, this blog doesn't have much ðŸ˜‚). I probably will also translate the old articles in the future, but for now, it will stay in French.
